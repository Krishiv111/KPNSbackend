# Cancer Research Project on AWS

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a cancer research project hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project utilizes EC2 instances to process and analyze cancer research data, which is managed through a controller and API with SQL database integration.

## Project Structure
- **EC2 Instances**: The project utilizes EC2 instances for scalable computing power to process and analyze cancer research data.
- **Controller and API**: The controller and API are used to manage and interact with the data stored in the SQL database.
- **SQL Database**: SQL database stores the cancer research data and allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data.

## Usage
To access and utilize the cancer research project on AWS, follow these steps:
1. **Access EC2 Instances**: AWS EC2 instances in order to 
2. **Controller and API**: Utilize the provided controller and API endpoints to interact with the cancer research data stored in the SQL database.

## Visual thoughts

- Starter code should be fun and practical
- Organize with Bootstrap menu 
- Add some color and fun through VANTA Visuals (birds, halo, solar, net)
- Show some practical and fun links (hrefs) like Twitter, Git, Youtube
- Show student project specific links (hrefs) per page
- Show student About me pages

## Getting started

- Clone project and open in VSCode
- Verify Project Structure to use a good Java JDK (adoptopenjdk:17)
- Play or entry point is Main.java, look for Run option in code.  This eanbles Spring to load
- Java source (src/main/java/...) has Java files.  Find "controllers" path, these files enable HTTP route and HTML file relationship.
- HTML source (src/main/resources/...) had templates and supporting files.  Find index.html as this file is launched by defaul in Spring.  Other HTML files are loaded by building an "@Controller"

## IDE management

- A ".gitignore" can teach a Developer a lot about Java runtime.  A target directory is created when you press play button, byte code is generated and files are moved into this location.
- "pom.xml" file can teach you a lot about Java dependencies.  This is similar to "requirements.txt" file in Python.  It manages packages and dependencies.
